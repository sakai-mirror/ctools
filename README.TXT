This directory holds resources required for specific builds of
CTools.  This includes build scripts and copies of files changed for
this CTools release.  That could include Sakai files if necessary, but
that should be rare.  It may well include CTools specific files when
work on the trunk in CTools is not appropriate for this build.

2006/11/01 - Copied from
https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/ctools/branches/ctools_2-2-x
revision 17731.   Code that is branched from elsewhere is deleted, as
2.3 provides a clean start.
