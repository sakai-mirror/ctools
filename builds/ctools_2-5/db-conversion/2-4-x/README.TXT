This contains scripts to deal with changes in the db as we update
within the 2.4.x branch. 

The conversion from 2.3.0C to 2.4.0 was really to a version of 2.4.x.
We call it 2-4-xA in the externals directory (far) under the ctools
builds directory. 

2007/07/25:
Create script for 2.4.xA to 2.4.xB conversion.
