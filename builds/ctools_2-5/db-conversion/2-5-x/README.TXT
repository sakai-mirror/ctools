This documents the db conversions required for CTools 2.5.

The txt file is a compact version of the actual conversion sql.  It
can be converted back and forth from the compact and the expanded
version by running it through the readablePermissions.pl script above
this directory.

** 2.4 -> 2.5 CONVERSION

2008/06/03 - The file JL2.5_permissions.txt has the latest conversion
commands. We  don't need to do the content or assignments conversion
as they have been done earlier near the end of reign of CTools 2.4.
