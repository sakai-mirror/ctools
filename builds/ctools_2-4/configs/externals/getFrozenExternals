# take .externals file in svn, get the latest revision number for

# - A file with the exact revision number for each entry
# - A file where all the revision numbers are the maximum revision number found in the prior set.
# These files can be used as the basis for a customized externals file for a specific build.

# This second file will get the same set of files, with less maintenance of revision numbers.
