For some reason the patches for these changes did not generate
correctly via svn diff. The Java code patches had duplicate changes,
so I delete the duplicate.  The vm change did not work, so I created a
diff between the 2.3.0 tag and the current trunk.  This appears to be
ok, but should be carefully checked on testctools.
