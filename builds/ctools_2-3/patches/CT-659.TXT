This patch was generated by hand.  The original and the new files
were copied to the same directory.  The diff was generated by using
'diff -u <original> <umich version> >> CT-659.patch' separately for
both files needing change.  The path was fixed up by hand to work from
the same directory that the other patch files run from.

Why use a patch rather than separate files?  There were only two files
with small changes and the patch mechanism was easy to use for
this. If the changes get any larger or affect more files then there
should be a directory made for the new files and they should be copied
over the default files, or RWiki should be adjusted during the build
to refer to a different directory with the UMich file versions in
them.

Even better is to get the files into Sakai as resources.
