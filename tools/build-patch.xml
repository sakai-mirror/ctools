      Apply patches to the exported source.  Should also work for checked out source.
      Note that the naming convention for the patch files is to use the revisions required to 
      GENERATE the patch.  That means the first revision number will be 1 less than first revision
      with a change, so that those differences will be extracted.
      Note also that the patch should work in the environment of an extracted Sakai distribution.  
      The '/trunk' element may need to be removed from the path.
