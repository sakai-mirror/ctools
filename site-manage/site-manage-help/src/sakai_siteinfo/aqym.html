<h2>Site Info: Overview</h2>



<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>The Site Info tool provides
information about the worksite that you are currently in. If you have
a role that allows it, you can use this tool to make changes to
information about the site, tools available in the site, and access to
the site. You can also publish the site using the Site Info tool.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Customizable:</strong> Site Info displays a participant list, so that
you can edit access to your site. It also displays a list of tools
available in the application, which you may add to or remove from your
worksite. You can alter your site's appearance and description as
well.</p>


<h3>Things to consider</h3>

<ul><li>The functions of the Site
Info tool are also available through the Worksite Setup
tool, which is available on the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> when you are in
<a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>If you have limited permissions, Site Info will show you only the information
about the worksite published by the site owner.
</li></ul>
