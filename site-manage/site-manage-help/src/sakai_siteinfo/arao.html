<h2>Importing material from another site you
own</h2>

 

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To complete the procedures in this
document, you must be assigned a role having the necessary
permissions.  To determine your role, follow the directions in <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbu">Participant roles</a>.  For a
basic understanding of roles and permissions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arax">Permissions and roles: Overview</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are planning to combine rosters, it's best to do so before adding content.
 Combining rosters does <strong>not</strong> import content (e.g.,
calendar items, assignments, forums, announcements) into the parent
site. If you already have content in the sites you want to combine, you should be able to import instructor-generated content (e.g., announcements, assignments, tool settings) using the instructions below.  However, submitted material, such as completed assignments, forum postings, or grades, cannot be imported using the following method.  You may want to download and save any submitted material before combining rosters. Once rosters have been combined into a parent site, the tools for the original sites are disabled.  However, you can enable them by using <strong><code>Worksite Setup</code></strong> from <strong><code>My Workspace</code></strong>.  For instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbj">Adding, editing, or deleting tools on the menubar from Worksite Setup</a>.</p>

<p>For any course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a> you create, you can import
content from other sites you own. You can also combine material from
more than one site. To do this:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of the destination site, click <strong><code>Site Info</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>At the top of the Site
Info screen, click <strong><code>Import from Site</code></strong>.

<br /><br />

</li><li>Select the box next to the site that contains the
source material.  You can choose more than one site. Then click <strong><code>Continue</code></strong>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Under the name of the site(s) you selected, check the box next to
each tool that contains source material you want to import. If a box is
grayed out, it means the corresponding tool is not available in that
site. Then click <strong><code>Finish</code></strong>.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Items saved as drafts in the source site will
be imported as drafts, which means they are not immediately viewable by
participants. To make them viewable, you must post them. For
instructions, see <a href="content.hlp?docId=arbk">Posting an assignment previously saved as a draft</a>.</p>
